"""Orchestrates evidence retrieval for one reaction step.

Order of attempts, stopping at the first that yields anything:

  1. exact precedent            -> EXPERIMENTAL
  2. similar precedents         -> SIMILAR_EXPERIMENTAL (aggregated)
  3. condition prediction model -> PREDICTED
  4. nothing                    -> UNAVAILABLE, with a reason

Every failure path degrades to UNAVAILABLE. Nothing in here can raise into the
retrosynthesis request: a route that solved stays solved even if the database is
down, the provider is missing, or retrieval times out.

#: measured. It made the system silent on 43% of queries and, when it did
#: answer, put a correct-transformation reaction first 87% of the time; with no
#: floor at all those figures were 29% and 95%. The floor was discarding good
#: results, not filtering bad ones.
#:
#: 0.20 rather than 0.00 is a product judgement, not a measurement: 0.00 scored
#: marginally better on every metric, but it would also let a reaction scoring
#: 0.05 be shown under the heading "SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL PRECEDENT". A floor
