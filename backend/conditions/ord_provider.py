"""ORD-backed evidence provider.

Reads only the flattened index in Postgres - never a protobuf, never
ord-schema. Ingestion lives in scripts/ingest_ord.py under a separate conda env,
so the serving environment keeps AiZynthFinder's pins untouched.

Retrieval uses V2.2 transformation-keyed indexing (hybrid strategy):
  1. PREFILTER in Postgres using the transformation difference, substrate
     Morgan fingerprints, and exact reaction centre matches.
  2. RANK candidates by combining transformation and substrate similarity.

#: Weighting for the combined ranking score, set from the retrieval benchmark
#: (scripts/benchmark_retrieval.py, 700 queries graded against ORD's own
#: REACTION_TYPE labels) rather than from intuition.
#:
#: The original 0.65/0.35 guess was on the wrong side. Measured P@1 across two
#: seeds: 0.2-0.4 transformation is the stable optimum (0.536-0.551), 0.5 is
#: slightly worse (0.514-0.537), and pure transformation similarity is worst
#: (0.459-0.480). Substrate similarity is the stronger signal here.
#:
#: CAVEAT, because this matters more than the number: the benchmark's labelled
#: chemistry is industrial HTE, where each reaction-type campaign uses
#: characteristic substrate classes. Substrate similarity may therefore be
#: partly proxying "which campaign is this from", which would not generalise
#: outside HTE data. 0.30 sits at the measured optimum; anything in 0.2-0.4 is
#: within noise, and a higher transformation share may well be safer on
#: non-HTE chemistry. Re-run the benchmark before trusting this elsewhere.
TRANSFORMATION_WEIGHT = 0.30
SUBSTRATE_WEIGHT = 0.70

#: Cartridge similarity floor for the prefilter, loosened from 0.5 on benchmark
#: evidence. At 0.5 only 52.6% of queries were offered a single relevant
#: reaction, which caps everything downstream.
#:
#: Measured trade-off (700 queries, fine labels):
#:
#:     threshold  P@1    silent  offered-any-relevant  candidates  latency/step
#:     0.3        0.536  12.9%   60.1%                 514         ~1.6 s
#:     0.4        0.516  27.6%   56.0%                 180         ~0.6 s
#:     0.5        -      -       52.6%                 123         ~0.6 s
#:
#: 0.3 retrieves better. 0.4 is shipped anyway because stage 2 re-normalises and
#: re-fingerprints every candidate on every request, so cost scales directly
#: with candidate count - and 1.6 s per step is too much for an interactive
#: plan. That is a fixable implementation problem, not a retrieval one:
#: precompute candidate fingerprints into Postgres and 0.3 (or lower) becomes
#: affordable. Revisit this constant when that lands.
#:
#: The deeper limit is structural and tuning cannot reach it: product similarity
#: is a poor proxy for "same transformation", so stage 1 is keyed on the wrong
#: thing. See docs/retrieval-benchmark.md.
