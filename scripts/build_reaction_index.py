"""Build the transformation-keyed retrieval index (V2.2).

Populates `ord_reaction_index` from `ord_reactions`. Derived data only - safe to
drop and rebuild, and it never becomes a source of truth.

    conda activate retrosynth
    python scripts/build_reaction_index.py [--rebuild] [--limit N]

The reaction fingerprints are computed BY THE CARTRIDGE, in SQL, so the index
and the query use byte-identical code. Only the reaction centre (which the
cartridge has no function for) is computed in Python.

Why this exists: V2.1 retrieved candidates by product-molecule similarity, which
benchmarking showed is keyed on the wrong thing - it offered no relevant
candidate at all for ~44% of queries. See docs/retrieval-benchmark.md.
